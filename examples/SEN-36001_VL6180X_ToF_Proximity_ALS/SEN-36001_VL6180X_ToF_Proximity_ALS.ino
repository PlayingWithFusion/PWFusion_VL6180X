* APPLICATION SPECIFIC NOTES (READ THIS!!!):
* The VL6180X is a unique Time-of-Flight proximity sensor that uses a Class 1
* IR laser. The range of the sensor is 0-200mm. The VL6180X also contains a
* built-in ambient light sensor. It is used in many cell phone and motion
* gesture applications.
* - This code configures an Arduino to interface with a VL6180X from ST Microelectronics
*    - Configure Arduino (I2C, UART, etc)
*    - Perform initial verification and configuration of the VL6180X
*    - read status/info from sensor
*    - Write formatted information to serial port
* - I2C specific note: This example uses the I2C interface via the I2C lib, not
*   the 'Wire' lib included with the Arduino IDE.
* 
* Circuit:
*    Arduino Uno   Arduino Mega  -->  SEN-36001: VL6180X Breakout
*    SDA:    SDA        SDA      -->  SDA
*    SCL:    SCL        SCL      -->  SCL
*    GND:    GND        ''       -->  GND
*    5V:     5V         ''       -->  VDD 
*    GPIO0/1 are not used in this example. They could be used for interrupts
*    (note: VDD should match voltage of IO, and can be between 3.3 and 5V)
